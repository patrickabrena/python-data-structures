Notes on the ordering_system_passed.py

where I went wrong originally is thinking that the order list was only containing an array of just the numbers ...
order = [3, 1, 5]

 instead it would look like....

order = [
    {"name": "cake", "price": 2.79},
    {"name": "espresso", "price": 1.99},
    {"name": "sandwich", "price": 4.99}
]
